        "Welcome to the Applied Accessibility Challenges!",
        "\"Accessibility\" generally means packaging your web content and creating a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by the broadest audience possible. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users may rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software, and others may only be able to navigate through a site using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards achieving the goal of an open web.",

        "Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Given these characteristics, screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values. If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, you wouldn't put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline, right? Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content - ones with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.",
        "As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labeled with h4 tags would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.",

Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.",

This is to illustrate the importance of creating a logical document outline, and using semantically meaningful tags around your content before introducing the visual design aspect. However, CSS's magic can also improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is clearly conveyed in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.",

First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them. We've covered having text alternatives to address the first issue, and the last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.",

You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors. In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be targeted by darkening the darker color and lightening the lighter one with the aid of a color contrast checker. Darker colors on the color wheel are considered to be blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.",

Increase the background-color lightness value from 35% to 55%, and decrease the color lightness value from 20% to 15%. This improves the contrast to 5.9:1."

We'll start with the special values of zero and -1.",
        "Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page, in the same order as they come in the HTML source markup.
